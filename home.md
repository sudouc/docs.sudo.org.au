## Stack

At Sudo, we like to teach a specific stack that best fits ease-of-use and concept-building that also allows our members to then switch into other branches of the same area.

- PHP / Laravel 5.4 – [Laravel Docs](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/)
- Python 2.7 / 3.0
- Foundation Framework – [Docs](foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/)
- Git / Github – [Video Tutorials](https://laracasts.com/series/git-me-some-version-control/episodes/1)
- Ubuntu 16.04 / 17.04
- Apache + Nginx

To aid you in learning these great tools, we've purchased a Laracasts subscription for the group. To access it, go to the sudouc/perks repository.
